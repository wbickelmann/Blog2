The normal distribution is an extremely important concept for statistics. The assumption of a normal distribution is the only thing that allows for a number of statistical techniques, such as linear regression. 

The greater the number of observations, the more likely the distribution will look normal. 

For example a varible with only 30 observations looks a little off:
```{r cars}
plot(density(rnorm(30)))
```
The plot above looks a little off. It seems a little skewed to the right. Lets try again with 10 times the number of observations

```{r}
plot(density(rnorm(300)))
```
This definitely looks better. But lets see if it will look even better if we add another zero onto the number of observations
