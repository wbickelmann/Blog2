Linear and Logistic Regression

Linear regression is a technique used in statistics which can be used  to display a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The technique plots data points and draws a line of best fit. Linear regression is one of the most common types of regression and one of the most popular predictive modeling techniques. The most used technique of calculating the line of best fit is ordinary least squares, which makes the line which has the minimum squared of the residuals. This will be covered with more detail in another post.

For this regression model, the dependent variable should be continuous and the independent variables should be discrete or continuous. Linear regression can explain how much of an effect the independent variable(s) have on the dependent variable. In addition to this, it can be used to   predict the effect of shifts in the independent variables on the dependent variable. Linear regression also identifies and can be used to attain data point estimates.


Logistic regression is a specific type of regression used when the dependent variable is binary(takes one of two possible values). The independent variables can be discrete and/or continuous. "The important point here to note is that in linear regression, the expected values of the response variable are modeled based on combination of values taken by the predictors. In logistic regression Probability or Odds of the response taking a particular value is modeled based on combination of values taken by the predictors" (Penn State Eberly College of Science).

Logistic regression is essentially used to predict when a whether a value will be 1 or 0. Another difference between OLS and logistic regression is that R squared is not use dot measure overall fit.
