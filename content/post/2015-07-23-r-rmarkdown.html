<p>The normal distribution is an extremely important concept for statistics. The assumption of a normal distribution is the only thing that allows for a number of statistical techniques, such as linear regression.</p>
<p>The greater the number of observations, the more likely the distribution will look normal.</p>
<p>For example a varible with only 30 observations looks a little off:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(density(rnorm(30)))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown_files/figure-html/cars-1.png" width="672" /> The plot above looks a little off. It seems a little skewed to the right. Lets try again with 10 times the number of observations</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(density(rnorm(300)))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /> This definitely looks better. But lets see if it will look even better if we add another zero onto the number of observations</p>
