The Social Media Analysis Project will be assessing ethnic tensions inn South Africa. Both in South Africa and the neighboring country of Zimbabwe, the indigenous population display a resentment towards white European settlers; causing many to speculate that they may be the target of a genocide in the near future. The primary focus of the analysis will be the language used on social media directed at the targeted group.

While any type of negative language between the groups of the country could be a key indicator of how extreme the ethnic tensions are; several studies indicate that disgust may have the most predictive power.

According to Kathleen Taylor, D.Phil. in "Disgust and extreme prejudice", the emotion of disgust "May prompt either avoidance or attempts to remove the disgusting stimulus, depending on which is easier to achieve". She performed a study on several anti-group texts including Mein Kampf to discern the language of bigotry. She made a number of predictions about the usage of the language in the anti-group text in question.

The first prediction she made was that polarization between groups are more extreme and salient when the minority group elicits disgust than anger or other negative emotions. The second prediction is that minority groups who transgress (or who are believed to transgress) majority social codes in disgust-sensitive domains - e.g. food, sex, waste disposal -are more likely to be targets of extreme hostility, atrocities and genocide than those who do not. Propaganda focusing on these areas will be a feature of the build-up to atrocities. The third prediction perpetrator training prior to planned atrocities should include what one may term "disgust ordeals": deliberately confronting the trainee with disgusting stimuli while providing highly rewarding group feedback.

The conclusions drawn from texts specifically makes this study a good guide for social media analysis, since the analysis will largely be drawn from text directed a targeted group.
