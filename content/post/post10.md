Both seek to make sense of data and provide methods of prediction and classification. In practice there is similar reliance on methods such as linear and logistic regression as well as resampling methods. The metrics of success in the respective fields. For example:  a statistician is likely to measure the merits of a model for instance in terms of a p-value or an R-squared (focusing on the statistical significance or variance explained). A Machine Learning engineer is more likely to employ root mean square error (rmse), or classification accuracy versus no-information rate. This indicates that the primary goal for Machine learning engineers is prediction. On the other hand, statisticians are interested in the relationship between variables and statistical significance instead of predictions.

Additionally there is a difference in emphasis between the two fields. . Machine learning algorithms learn from the data by using training and test sets: this is not always the case with traditional statistical models. Machine learning is more focused on computing and sometimes developing neural networks, using deep learning to solve problems and make predictions about things which are not plainly numeric, such as image recognition. Statistics does not broach many of these topic and instead, much scholarship in statistics in devoted to sampling methods (with some overlap in social science), and different ways of understanding data.
