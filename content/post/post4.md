Like the famous leader Nelson Mandela, Jacob Zuma has a background littered with criminal actions. He was convicted of conspiring to overthrow the apartheid government and imprisoned for 10 years on the notorious Robben Island, alongside Mandela. After his prison sentence ended, he left the country for a number of years, and lived in Mozambique and Zambia, meanwhile gaining power in the ANC political party. When he returned he used his elevated status and influence to negotiate condition of apartheid policies with the Afrikaner ruling class. He took office as president in 2009, when he won an election against Thabo Mbeki, charismatically tailoring his persona as relatable to the public, unlike his opponent, whom he labeled a distant "intellectual king". 

Unlike Mandela, Zuma, did not leave his criminal actions behind him after his rise to prominence. Zuma had a number of criminal charges since his return to South Africa including a charge of corruption in 2005, over a multi-billion-dollar arms deal. These charges were dropped after his rise to presidency. However, in 2016, South African courts reopened and pressed charges against the president. Zuma appealed the case and it is currently ongoing. Additionally, Zuma was involved in a scandal in 2016 when Zuma allegedly used federal funds to make an upgrade to his private residence. He has since paid back the funds. In 2017 there was an officially inquiry into his relationship with a wealthy South African family called the Guptas. The alleged crime was using his position and relationship with the family to profit personally.


Coupled with his campaign to reclaim property from white landowners without compensation, Zuma's scandalous background and propensity for corruption, do not paint an optimistic picture for harmonious race relations in South Africa.
