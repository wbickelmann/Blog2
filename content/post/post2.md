Apartheid is a word in Afrikaans meaning "apartness". True to the translation, apartheid were a set of South African policies designed to racially segregate society. The policies pertained to residential areas, public facilities, and otherwise limit contact between the black majority and the white minority.

The policies separating whites from blacks began three years after South Africa declared independence, in 1914 with the Land act, which forced black Africans to live in reserves and making it illegal for them to work as sharecroppers. However, the many of the laws that made-up apartheid did become policy until 1948 when Afrikaner National Party won the general election under the slogan "apartheid" advertising racial segregation as a main tenant of the party's platform.

The Population Registration Act of 1950 passed shortly afterward forcing citizens to register as a member of their respective race, then using this framework to pass legislation making marriage and sexual relations between blacks and whites illegal. Furthermore, the ANP government passed a series of land acts which passed 80 percent of the nation's land to whites. These policies resulted in 3.5 million black South Africans forcibly removed from their homes, as much farmland was designated for whites only.

Policies such as these continued until 1990 when F.W. de Klerk repealed most of the social legislation segregating the races. Despite this, the legacy of segregation became part of the social discourse, and the races remained separated in day to day life. Tensions lessened under Nelson Mandela, who advocated for peace between ethnic groups, but it seems that under current president Jacob Zuma, ethnic tensions have risen again.
