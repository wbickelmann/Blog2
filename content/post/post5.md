As part of a larger analysis on white nationalism around the world, this analysis will focus on the resurging white nationalist movement in America.

White racial consciousness became more popular than it has in decades, during the 2016 presidential election, as part of a larger growth of anti-establishment conservatism called the alt-right. The prevalence of white identitarianism in this movement became the subject of much speculation after Richard Spencer shouted, "Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory" before five people in the audience gave the Roman salute at a National Policy Institute meeting. After Donald Trump's election, anti-establishment conservatives, began to abandon the label alt-right, calling themselves alt-lite or New Right. The term alt-right now primarily refers to white identitarians.

The people and organizations that call themselves alt-right, usually range between white advocates, who want to advocate for policies in favor of white people, and white nationalists, who want an ethnostate, free of non Europeans and usually Jews.  Those on the alt-right largely disagree on which policies they want implemented, why the alt-right contains nationalists, libertarians, national socialists, and even fascists.  The only thing binding the various groups on the alt-right are identity politics in favor of Caucasians.
Despite this lack of unity, the alt-right terrified the United States in August when a coalition of people who appeared to be white identitarians, marched in Charlottesville chanting "Jews will not replace us" as part of a rally called "Unite the Right". Violent clashes between Antifa, the right-wing protestors and police followed.

Some of the leaders on the alt-right include Jared Taylor who according to some, is the "Father of the alt-right." Richard Spencer, who coined the term, alt-right and is head of the white nationalist think tank, National Policy Institute. Nathan Damigo, who founded Identity Evropa, Matthew Heimbach who leads the Traditionalist Workers Party and many other influential individuals.
