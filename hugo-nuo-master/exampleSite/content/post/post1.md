In March 2017, President Jacob Zuma attempted to rally legislators to allow for the seizing of all white-owned farmland in an effort to establish 'pre-colonial' land distribution. In order to do this, Zuma proposed the unification of all black political parties, in order to author a controversial change to the South African constitution. Zuma wishes to do this without compensating white land owners for property seized.

Zuma is not alone in his thinking among black politicians; his call for unification follows a campaign by Julius Malema, a South African politician, who has called on the native population to take back land stolen by 'Dutch thugs'. Malema also said in the 2017 Spring

>  'So, we are saying black people, all of us must unite so that we can change the constitution so that we can expropriate land without compensation. There is no white man that will understand it.'


These calls for reconquering of farmland took place amidst several attacks on white land owners by black vagrants, leaving the victims robbed, beaten, raped and often killed. The resentment against white land owners does not seem to be a new problem as the number of white farmer killed between 1990 and present day are between 2000 and 4000.

The wave of anti-white resentment does not seem exclusive to crime and politics as there have been other notorious incidents of the native South African population showing their disdain for the Afrikaners. Among these include a 2016 riot at Cape Town University over fees where black youths stormed the dining hall stealing paintings of white South Africans and burning them in the street. The rioters also barred white and Indian students from entering the university dining hall, denying them access to food, and set vehicles and administrative offices ablaze. Rioters sang anti-Afrikaner songs including "Kill the Boer".
